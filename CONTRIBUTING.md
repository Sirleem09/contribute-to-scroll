First I will like to appreciate the wholw Scroll team. I must say you all are doing an amazing job, I mean Scroll is a top project with fast and switch transaction. And the interoperability is second to non with all other L2 out there. I implore you to keep up the good work. Finally, I will advice you guys not to rush the project just take your time and give in your best. I would suggest your ticker be $roll if you dont have one already. Thank you
